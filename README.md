Basic Computer Vision. 

When run, uses a webcam to detect users hand placement on a coloured keyboard.

Run from final.py, note that it might take a minute to open the camera. 

If it is struggling to load your webcamera, try changing the number in line 66:

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

0 is the default web camera, but it could be on other numbers.
